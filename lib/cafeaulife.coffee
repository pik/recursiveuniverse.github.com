# # Cafe au Life

## What

# Cafe au Life is an implementation of John Conway's [Game of Life][life] cellular automata
# written in [CoffeeScript][cs]. Cafe au Life runs on [Node.js][node], it is not designed
# to run as an interactive program in a browser window.
#
# Cafe au Life's Github project is [here](https://github.com/recursiveuniverse/recursiveuniverse.github.com/).
#
# This file, [cafeaulife.coffee][source] contains the core engine for computing the future of any life universe
# of size `2^n | n > 1`. The algorithm is optimized for computing very large numbers of generations
#  of very large and complex life patterns with a high degree of regularity such as implementing
# Turing machines.
#
# As such, it is particularly poorly suited for animating displays a generation at a time. But it
# is still a beautiful algorithm that touches on the soul of life’s “physics."

#
# ### Conway's Life and other two-dimensional cellular automata
#
# The Life Universe is an infinite two-dimensional matrix of cells. Cells are indivisible and are in either of two states,
# commonly called "alive" and "dead." Time is represented as discrete quanta called either "ticks" or "generations."
# With each generation, a rule is applied to decide the state the cell will assume. The rules are decided simultaneously,
# and there are only two considerations: The current state of the cell, and the states of the cells in its
# [Moore Neighbourhood][moore], the eight cells adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
#
# Cafe au Life implements Conway's Game of Life, as well as other "[life-like][ll]" games in the same family.

#
# ## Why
#
# Cafe au Life is based on Bill Gosper's brilliant [HashLife][hl] algorithm. HashLife is usually implemented in C and optimized
# to run very long simulations with very large 'boards' stinking fast. The HashLife algorithm is, in a word,
# **a beautiful design**, one that is "in the book." To read its description is to feel the desire to explore it on a computer.
#
# Broadly speaking, HashLife has two major components. The first is a high level algorithm that is implementation independent.
# This algorithm exploits repetition and redundancy, aggressively 'caching' previously computed results for regions of the board.
# The second component is the cache itself, which is normally implemented cleverly in C to exploit memory and CPU efficiency
# in looking up precomputed results.
#
# Cafe au Life is an exercise in exploring the beauty of HashLife's recursive caching or results, while accepting that the
# performance in a JavaScript application will not be anything to write home about.

# ## How

# Cafe au Life is based on two very simple classes:
#
# The smallest unit of Life is the `Cell`. The constructor is set up to call an `initialize` method to make point-cuts slightly easier.
#
# HashLife operates on square regions of the board, with the length of the side of each square being a natural power of two
# (`2^1 -> 2`, `2^2 -> 4`, `2^3 -> 8`...). Naturally, squares are represented by instances of the class `Square`. The smallest possible square
# (of size `2^1`) has cells for each of its four quadrants, while all larger squares (of size `2^n`) have squares of one smaller
# size (`2^(n-1)`) for each of their four quadrants.
#
# For example, a square of size eight (`2^3`) is composed of four squares of size four (`2^2`):
#
#     nw         ne
#       ....|....
#       ....|....
#       ....|....
#       ....|....
#       ————#————
#       ....|....
#       ....|....
#       ....|....
#       ....|....
#     sw         se
#
# The squares of size four are in turn each composed of four squares of size two (`2^1`):
#
#     nw           ne
#       ..|..|..|..
#       ..|..|..|..
#       ——+——|——+——
#       ..|..|..|..
#       ..|..|..|..
#       —————#—————
#       ..|..|..|..
#       ..|..|..|..
#       ——+——|——+——
#       ..|..|..|..
#       ..|..|..|..
#     sw           se
#
# And those in turn are each composed of four cells, which cannot be subdivided. (For simplicity, a Cafe au Life
# board is represented as one such large square, although the HashLife algorithm can be used to handle any board shape by tiling it with squares.)

# Cafe au Life is divided into modules:
#
# * The [Rules Module][rules] provides a method for setting up the [rules][ll] of the Life universe.
# * The [Future Module][future] provides methods for computing the future of a pattern, taking into account its ability to grow beyond
# the size of its container square.
# * The [Cache Module][cache] implements a very naive hash-table for canoncial representations of squares. HashLife uses extensive
# [canonicalization][canonical] to optimize the storage of very large patterns with repetitive components. **New**: Garbage collection
# allows Cafe au Life to compute the future of patterns with high entropy.
# * The [Garbage Collection Module][gc] implements a simple reference-counting garbage collector for the cache. For more information,
# read [Implementing Garbage Collection in CS/JS with Aspect-Oriented Programming][igc]
# * The [API Module][api] provides methods for grabbing json or strings of patterns and resizing them to fit expectations.
# * The [Menagerie Module][menagerie] provides a few well-know life objects predefined for you to play with. It is entirely optional.
#
# The modules will build up the functionality of our `Cell` and `Square` classes.

# If this is your first time through the code, start with the [Rules Module][rules], and then read the [Future Module][future]
# to understand the core algorithm for computing the future of a pattern. You can look at the [Cache][cache], [Garbage Collection][gc],
# and [API][api] modules at your leisure.
